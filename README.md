# 🪴Plant Disease Detection Model🪴
A project that detects plant disease in plant leaves by harnessing the power of Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Agricultural Technology.

## 📖Project Overview
The Plant Disease Detection Model is a project explores ways to identify diseases in plants. We accomplished this by leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. Developing this model and continuously improving upon it, would be a great complementary technology for the agriculture industry that would aid in earlier detection of plant diseases.

## ⚙️Model Summary
Within my model and other models that have focused on the same industry, there has been many different technologies used. For rmy specific model, I decided to use a ViT (Visual Transformer). The ViT was used in this model because it is versatile and has a very high capacity for data. The transformer is also very good at computer vision tasks. The model was pretrained with the selected dataset and then fined tuned.

## 📈Dataset
The dataset that is used in this project comes from Kaggle.com and is named PlantVillage Dataset. PlantVillage contains over 50k images of diseased and healthy plant leaves. Preprocessing was used to train the model. The over 50k PlantVillage dataset was used in this process.

## 🚀How to Run the Project
1. Open your IDE of choice. Make sure the following are installed:
   -   Python
3. Download the [Streamlit](streamlit.py) file in my directory to make sure all modules are imported. You will need to import the following:
   -   Numpy
   -   PIL
   -   Streamlit
   -   Tensorflow
4. Open the terminal and using Python type the following streamlit run streamlit.py. That should result in opening a tab in your browser that says [localhost:8501]() and that will be my Plant Disease Detection Model application.
