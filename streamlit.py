Your best resource for Plant Disease Recognition. Our model quickly and accurately detect diseases in plants using just an image.

---

## How It Works

1. **Capture or Upload an Image**: Take a clear picture of your plant's leaf or upload an existing image.
2. **Let the Model Analyze**: Our AI-powered model analyzes the image and identifies potential diseases.
3. **Get Instant Results**: Receive the name of the disease, a short description, and treatment suggestions.

---

##  Why Choose My Model?

-  **High Accuracy**: Trained on thousands of labeled images across various plant species.
-  **Fast Inference**: Get results in seconds with minimal resource usage.
-  **AI-Powered Insights**: Uses advanced deep learning techniques for high precision.
-  **Easy to Use**: Built with simplicity in mind.

---

##  Get Started

1. Click on **"Upload Image"** the Disease Recognition page.
2. Wait a few seconds while the model processes your image.
3. View what class the diseased leaf belongs to.

    st.markdown(""" Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an expected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people. Currently, infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. The widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020 offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Here we announce the release of over 50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing online platform PlantVillage. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.
